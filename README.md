# Guess The Number Game
This HTML file contains the basic structure of a "Guessing Game". The game aims to have the user guess a number and provides a user interface for that purpose.<br/>


The JavaScript code is responsible for the functionality of the game. It contains the necessary functions to evaluate user guesses and update the game's state. The `play()` function takes the user's guess and checks its accuracy. If the guess is incorrect, it provides a hint to the user and updates the number of guesses and guessed numbers. If the guess is correct, it displays a congratulatory message and the results. The `init()` function sets the initial state of the game.<br/>

In the JavaScript code, variables are defined to access the HTML elements. Event listeners track button clicks and page load events to execute the corresponding functions.<br/>


This project implements a simple guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br/>
